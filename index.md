- 👋 Hi, I’m Caitlin (they/them)! I'm a biology PhD candidate at the University of Oregon.
- 👀 I’m interested in microbial ecology, community assembly, host-host/environment-to-host microbial transmission.
- 🧫 My background is in microbiology. I worked as a research technician in a plant-microbe interactions lab where I cultured a variety of bacteria and fungi associated with plant and soil communities.
- 🐟 I’m currently researching early-life microbiome assembly in zebrafish.
- 💻 I'm expanding my skills in R programming for data analysis and development of biology teaching tools.
- 📫 You can reach me via [email](mailto:csmith29@uoregon.edu)
